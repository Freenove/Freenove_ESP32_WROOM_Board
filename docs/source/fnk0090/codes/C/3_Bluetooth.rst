In this tutorial we need to use a Bluetooth APP called Serial Bluetooth Terminal to assist in the experiment. If you've not installed it yet, please do so by clicking: https://www.appsapk.com/serial-bluetooth-terminal/ The following is its logo.

Component knowledge
=======================================

ESP32's integrated Bluetooth function Bluetooth is a short-distance communication system, which can be divided into two types, namely Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) and Classic Bluetooth. There are two modes for simple data transmission: master mode and slave mode.

Master mode
--------------------------------------

In this mode, works are done in the master device and it can connect with a slave device. And we can search and select slave devices nearby to connect with. When a device initiates connection request in master mode, it requires information of the other Bluetooth devices including their address and pairing passkey. After finishing pairing, it can connect with them directly.

Slave mode
---------------------------------------

The Bluetooth module in slave mode can only accept connection request from a host computer, but cannot initiate a connection request. After connecting with a host device, it can send data to or receive from the host device.

Bluetooth devices can make data interaction with each other, as one is in master mode and the other in slave mode. When they are making data interaction, the Bluetooth device in master mode searches and selects devices nearby to connect to. When establishing connection, they can exchange data. When mobile phones exchange data with ESP32, they are usually in master mode and ESP32 in slave mode.

Reference
------------------------------

.. py:function:: Class BluetoothSerial	

    This is a class library used to operate BluetoothSerial, which can directly read and set BluetoothSerial. Here are some member functions:

    **begin(localName,isMaster):** Initialization function of the Bluetooth

    name: name of Bluetooth module; Data type: String

    **isMaster:** bool type, whether to set Bluetooth as Master. By default, it is false.

    **available():** acquire digits sent from the buffer, if not, return 0.

    **read():** read data from Bluetooth, data type of return value is int.

    **readString():** read data from Bluetooth, data type of return value is String.

    **write(val):** send an int data val to Bluetooth.

    **write(str):** send an Srtring data str to Bluetooth.

    **write(buf, len):** Sends the first len data in the buf Array to Bluetooth. 

    **setPin(const char *pin):** set a four-digit Bluetooth pairing code. By default, it is 1234

    **connet(remoteName):** connect a Bluetooth named remoteName, data type: String

    **connect(remoteAddress[]):** connect the physical address of Bluetooth, data type: uint8-t. 

    **disconnect():** disconnect all Bluetooth devices.

    **end():** disconnect all Bluetooth devices and turn off the Bluetooth, release all occupied space

Serial Bluetooth
-------------------------------------

Compile and upload code to ESP32, the operation is similar to the last section.

First, make sure you've turned on the mobile phone Bluetooth, and then open the software.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/3_Bluetooth/Chapter03_10.png
    :align: center

Click "Search" to search Bluetooth devices nearby and select "ESP32 test" to connect to.
